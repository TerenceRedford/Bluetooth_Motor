# Bluetooth_Motor
Terence Redford 

It was surprising to see how quickly changes I made online appeared on my desktop files, which is useful because it means I can leave my
laptop at home, and if I do work on a different device I can upload it into my github account online and retrieve it later to look at.

 
 Code for controlling two motors, an accelerometer, an ultrasonic distance sensor and an HC-05 bluetooth module with an arduino.
 This is also the current code I have for the Remote controlled car. I have verified that the bluetooth can recieve signals to drive or stop the motors,
 and that the ultrasonic distance sensor can inhibit the motors. at the moment the accelerometer values arent being used, but they are sent to the serial monitor
 to verify.
